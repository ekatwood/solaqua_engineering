# Solaqua Engineering

Solar panels + ocean water = clean H₂O

## What is it?

Solaqua is an engeering company with a primary focus on generating clean, potable water and Hydrogen gas using solar panels to boil ocean water.

There is a dire need in the world for fresh water, and Hydrogen fuel cell batteries should be easily accessible and easy to refuel.

## How does it work?

This repository houses the Linux and macOS applications that interact with the solar panels and water collection mechanism, so that it can be configured and monitored.

This code base will remain open source, and we will have a website where people can purchase all of the equipment they need to set up their own water and Hydrogen gas farming operation.

## How does Solaqua make money?

When Solaqua technology is used to farm and sell water or Hydrogen gas, a 3% royalty will be paid to our company.

## What is the implementation for the operation?

Solar panels and mirrors will be used to direct sunlight at a matte finish metallic petri dish, heating it to a boil. Condensation will be collected using a glass dome above the petri dish, and the harvested water will drip into a collection container.

Optionally, you will be able to continue the process and use solar panels to extract Hydrogen (H₂) gas, which also produces Oxygen (O₂) gas.

It is safe to release the Oxygen gas into the atmosphere as a byproduct, or you can store and sell it as well, for example to a hospital.

## What is the cost to start a Solaqua farming operation?

The goal is to have the base cost for one farming unit to be about $8,000 to set up. This will be an investment, but the idea is eventually you can make your money back by selling clean, potable water or Hydrgen gas. The 3% royalty should be low enough where this should not interfere with your ability to get your investment capital back and become profitable eventually.
